# LandslideRiskTool
ArcPy geoprocessing tool created as part of a final project for the university course GISci Programming. Due to time constraints and feasibility considerations, this script is a work in progress with known issues and limitations. Further improvements were researched and discussed in an accompanying paper. Anyone may use this script as a framework for their own project if they so wish.
